Note: There was a typo in the original Java code where `intA` is declared but not initialized before being used in `sc.nextInt()`. In the C++ version, I assumed `intA` should be declared before use. However, since the original code does not show the declaration, I included it in the C++ version for completeness. If `intA` was intended to be declared elsewhere in the original Java code, please adjust accordingly.
